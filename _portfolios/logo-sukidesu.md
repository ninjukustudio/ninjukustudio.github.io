# What We Did

<img src="/img/logo-sukidesu.jpg" alt="a two-line wordmark logo that reads Suki and Desu!" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

<img src="/img/bg-sukidesu.jpg" alt="said logo being applied onto various objects" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

For our client [SukiDesu! Kitchen](https://www.instagram.com/sukidesukitchen/), we designed their logo with two variants: single-line and two-line. The kitchen vibes are conveyed through the witty use of silhouettes and negative spaces.

# What Our Client Said
> The logo is so simple yet so cute! Truly represents the mood and vibes we want in our logo. We love it!
