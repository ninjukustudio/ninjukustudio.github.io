# What We Did

For our client [SIJIS](https://journalweb.org/ojs/index.php/SIJIS/index), we developed their journal website's OJS theme from the official Bootstrap theme of OJS 3.x, created a fully-styled DOCX file for their journal template, and provided aftersales technical support for 2 months.

# What Our Client Said
> Cool. Fast. Reliable. And more importantly, affordable!
