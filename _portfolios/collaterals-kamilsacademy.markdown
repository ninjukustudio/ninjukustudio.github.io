[Kamil's Academy 2022](https://campsite.bio/kamilsacademy) was a Muslim, pre-marriage workshop program offered by Muslim Post-Grad Student Association (KAMIL Pascasarjana) of Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) in 2022. We were in charge of developing the program's visual identity, including the logo, and creating its digital media collaterals accordingly.

The digital collaterals we created include but not limited to:
- program posters,
- Instagram post templates,
- PowerPoint presentation theme and template,
- certificate templates,
- Word document templates,
- virtual backgrounds,
- Twibbonize campaign, as well as
- bumper and closing videos.
