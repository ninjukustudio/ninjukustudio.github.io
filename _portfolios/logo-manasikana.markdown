# What We Did

<img src="/img/manasikana-logo.png" alt="Manasikana's logo" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

[Manasikana](https://manasikana.id) is a Tasikmalaya-based, Muslim clothing brand serving customers from all around Indonesia and beyond. We helped them develop their distinctive logo which conveys key characteristics of their brand positioning: **cozy, cute, and playful**.

# What Our Client Said
> We love our logo. It perfectly embodies the very qualities we want our customers to value us for. Ninjuku Studio did a great job coming up with several alternatives based on our initial prompt until we found the one we're looking for. Thanks, Ninjuku Studio!
